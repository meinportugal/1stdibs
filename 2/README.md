# Marketing Data

In this chapter we will address 2 points:
 - which products are often shown at the top of the search and are recommended for viewing.
 - which products sell the fastest

To start with the first one we will create a separate table in MySQL that will hold the product IDs, timestamp, position on the page and few boolean fields, for those cases, when the product was shown in "sponsored"or in the "recommended" section.
