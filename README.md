# 1stdibs

This is a small project to learn more about data collection, storage and visualization.

We chose the 1stdibs website because it is not a standard platform for posting goods. Only partly it can be called a marketplace. However, the nature of the goods, their speed of sale, strict moderation, as well as their availability (usually in a single copy) impose certain restrictions on the resulting sample and on the possibilities for research.

We will try to collect the most important information about products to understand what the main challenges facing sellers are, as well as what approaches allow sellers to be more successful in this market.

We will use available modern technologies and try to develop the most optimal approaches to solve the problem.

# Approximate plan:
1. Understand what categories are on the site and what is the growth dynamics of these categories
2. Find out which products are often shown at the top of the search and are recommended for viewing, as well as which products sell the fastest
3. Monitor the dynamics of positive feedback for successful sellers
4. Find a correlation between product description, price, seller rating and ranking in high search rankings

For each task we will use different directories within this project.
